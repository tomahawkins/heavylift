# HeavyLift

A large drone project for material transport.
Specifically, transporting
snowboarders to the tops of mountains.

## Ideas

- [Monocopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocopter) design for efficiency and easy transport.
    - Fits on a snowboard rack.
    - Inspired by the [Charles McCutchen flying machine](http://www.airplanesandrockets.com/airplanes/charybdis-oct-1972-aam.htm) (the Charybdis).

- Configuration
    - Powerhead (gas or electric) as counter weight.
        - If gas, fuel tank at center of rotation.
    - Drive propeller on wing.  Located in wingtip vortex for efficiency.
    - Motor drives prop via shaft or belt along inside of the wing.
    - At center, lift hook on swivel drops rope to poma or t-bar.
        - Swivel possibly driven by a motor to synchronize with rotation.
- Control
    - On ride up, directional sensor on board/skis controls direction of tow.
    - Limits on tow force and speed.
    - On ride down, drone tracks rider's position plus 150' altitude to clear trees and obstacles.
