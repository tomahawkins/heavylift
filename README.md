# HeavyLift

A large drone project for material transport.
Specifically, transporting
snowboarders to the tops of mountains.

## Ideas

- [Monocopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocopter) design for efficiency and easy transport.
    - Fits on a snowboard rack.
    - Inspired by the [Charles McCutchen flying machine](http://www.airplanesandrockets.com/airplanes/charybdis-oct-1972-aam.htm) (the Charybdis).

    - Yes, single blade helicopters [fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH9N9comEy4) just [fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD9juUWL5iU).
- Configuration
    - Powerhead (gas or electric) as counter weight.
        - If gas, fuel tank at center of rotation.
    - Drive propeller on wing.  Located in wingtip vortex for efficiency.
    - Motor drives prop via shaft or belt along inside of the wing.
    - At center, lift hook on swivel drops rope to poma or t-bar.
        - Swivel possibly driven by a motor to synchronize with rotation.
- Control
    - On ride up, directional sensor on board/skis controls direction of tow.
    - Limits on tow force and speed.
    - On ride down, drone tracks rider's position plus 150' altitude to clear trees and obstacles.


## [Cargo Hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_hook_%28helicopter%29) and Tow System

Noah and I tested the undriven swivel idea using a weighted rope attached to a swivel attached to a drill.
The rope spun just a little and produced only minor vibrations.
I was concerned the rope would start whipping around,
but at least in this test the weighted end remains very stable
(rope length ~10 feet, weight ~0.25 lbs).
We also tested the rope w/o the swivel.  This produced harmonics, but never
caused the rope end to go nuts.

[Rock Exotica](http://www.rockexotica.com) sells some very nice
[swivels](http://www.rockexotica.com/product/swivels/).
Probably the [Shackle Swivel](http://www.rockexotica.com/product/swivels/shackle-swivel/)
since it could bolt directly into the airframe.
