# How Do Monocopters Fly?

## Some questions that we want to answer:

- **How light does the monocopter have to be?**
- **What should the wing look like?  How big?**
- **How strong does the motor need to be?**
- **How far does the servo need to move the wing?**
- **How much lift does it need to generate?**
- **How do you steer and control a monocopter?**
- **How do you land a monocopter without breaking it?\***
  - \* We haven't learned how to do this yet.

## But most importantly, what don't we know that we don't know?

**So we'll build models, try to fly them,
and when they crash, we'll learn from our mistakes.**
