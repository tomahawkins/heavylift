# About the Monocopter Project

## by Noah and Tom Hawkins

This project was started several months ago by my dad and I.
We had an idea to build a big remote control helicopter 
pull us up steep mountains so we could ski down them.

This poster represents an overview of what we have accomplished so far.
It has been a team effort.  I've done a lot of work and my dad has too.
