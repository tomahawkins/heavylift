# About the Monocopter Project

## by Noah and Tom Hawkins

**This project was started several months ago by my dad and I.
We had an idea to build a big remote control helicopter 
pull us up steep mountains so we could ski down them.
It would then follow us down to the bottom to pick us up
for another run.**

**This poster represents an overview of what we have accomplished so far.
It has been a team effort.  I've done a lot of work and my dad has too.**

**If you are interested in monocopters, please check out
