# What We Are Learning

**It is harder to fly a monocopter than we thought.
We have been able to spin-up the monocopter to high speed,
but even with the wing at maximum pitch,
it still hasn't produced enough lift to take off.
We think the monocopter needs to be lighter
and the wing bigger.**

**We also need to figure out how to make landing gear
for the monocopter because every time the monocopter 
falls off the launch rod, the propeller breaks.**
